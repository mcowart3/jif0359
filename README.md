*Build Instructions*

- Unix

*Installation of Application*

No installation for the client is needed. Simply access that project at lettersminglesouls.lmc.gatech.edu.

*Run Instructions*

- Frontend Testing
  - Ensure that TestDocumentService is in use in App.tsx.
  - While in the /frontEnd directory, run the following command: `npm run start`.

*Troubleshooting*

If issues arise, ensure you're in the correct Conda environment (lms). Other common issues that may arise are attributed to missing dependencies on either your machine or the Conda environment. Install appropriate dependencies as needed. 

### Server Information

*Starting Server*

For the server at lettersminglesouls.lmc.gatech.edu, simply rebooting the server via "sudo reboot" while ssh's in will get things back into normal working order. The script "lms_startup.sh" in /etc/init.d has the list of commands being run during this process. Alternatively, you can just run the lms_startup script once ssh'd in.

*Starting from Scratch*

Clone this repo into a directory of your choice (we used /var/). Follow general build and run instructions above. You may have to perform general server administration tasks like setting up startup scripts or reverse proxies - this will vary based on your server environment.
