To your selfe.
SIR,
AGE becomes nothing better then Friendship; therefore your Letters, which are ever good effects of friendship, delight to be old before I receive them: for it is but a fortnight since those Letters which you sent by Captain  found me at  presently upon the receit, I adven∣tured by your leave to bestow the first mi∣nutes upon this Letter to your faire Noble Sister; And because I found no voice at  of any Messenger, I respited my Wri∣ting to you, till I came thus much nearer. Upon the way hither, another Letter from you overtooke me, which by my L.  love to me for your sake, was sent after me to  He came to  within two houres after I went away; which I tell you to let you see, that my For∣tune hath still that spitefull constancy, to bring me near my desires, and intercept me.

If I should write to you any newes from this place, I should forestall mine owne Market, by telling you beforehand that which must make me acceptable to you at my comming. I shall sneake into  about the end of  In my remotest di∣stances I did not more need your Letters then I shall then. Therefore if you shall not be then in  I beseech you to think mee at  and write one large Letter to be left at my Ladie  my lodging; for I shall come in extreame darknesse and ignorance, except you give me light. If Sir  be within your reach, present my humble service and thankfulnesse to him; if he be not, I am glad, that to my Conscience, which is a thousand witnesses, I have added you for one more, that I came as near as I could to doe it. I shall run so fast from this place, through  and some parts of  that all that love which you could perchance be content to expresse by Let∣ters if I lay still, may be more thriftily be∣stowed

upon that one Letter, which is by your favour, to meet me, and to welcome to 
Your unworthy, but very true Friend,
J. Donne.
