To Sir 

SIR,
IN the History or style of friendship, which is best written both in deeds and words, a Letter which is of a mixed nature, and hath something of both, is a mixed Pa∣renthesis: It may be left out, yet it contri∣butes, though not to the being, yet to the verdure, and freshnesse thereof. Letters have truly the same office, as oaths. As these amongst light and empty men, are but fil∣lings, and pauses, and interjections; but with weightier, they are sad attestations: So are Letters to some complement, and obli∣gation to others. For mine, as I never au∣thorized my servant to lie in my behalfe, (for if it were officious in him, it might be worse in me) so I allow my Letters much lesse that civill dishonesty, both because they go from me more considerately, and be∣cause they are permanent; for in them I may speak to you in your chamber a year hence before I know not whom, and not hear my

self. They shall therefore ever keep the sin∣cerity and intemeratenesse of the fountain, whence they are derived. And as whereso∣ever these leaves fall, the root is in my heart, so shall they, as that sucks good affections towards you there, have ever true impressi∣ons thereof. Thus much information is in very leaves, that they can tell what the tree is, and these can tell you I am a friend, and an honest man. Of what generall use, the fruit should speake, and I have none: and of what particular profit to you, your application and experimenting should tell you, and you can make none of such a no∣thing; yet even of barren Sycamores, such as I, there were use, if either any light flash∣ings, or scorching vehemencies, or sudden showres made you need so shadowy an example or remembrancer. But (Sir) your fortune and minde do you this happy in∣jury, that they make all kinde of fruits use∣lesse unto you; Therefore I have placed my love wisely where I need communicate nothing. All this, though perchance you

read it not till Michaelmas, was told you at  15.  1607.
