To Sir 

SIR,
THis is a second Letter: the enclosed was written before. Now we are sure that  is taken, and entred with extreme cruelties. Almost all the de∣fendors forsook their stations; only Sir  maintained his nobly, to the repulsing of the enemy three times, but ha∣ving ease in the other parts, 800 new fresh men were put upon his quarter, and after he had broke 4 Pikes, and done very well, he was shot dead in the place.  was soon after besieged, and is still.  was lost the 6 of this moneth. the K. upon news of this, sent to the Spanish Ambassa∣our, that the people were like to resent it, and therefore, if he doubted ought, he should have a Guard: but I do not see, that he seems to need it, in his own opinion, neither, intruth does he; the people are flat: or trust in God, and the Kings ways: Sir  hath written to his wife, (as I am

told) a Letter in the nature of a will, for the disposing of his estate and children, as though he did not account to see her any more, but yet  cannot be lost, but by storming. Your man stays, and our bell rings me into the Church; there Sir, I shall recommend you to Gods goodnesse, with

Your friend
J. Donne.
24 Septemb.
