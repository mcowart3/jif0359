To my worthy and honoured friend Mr 

SIR,
I Am sorry, if your care of me have made you importune to any body else; yet I cannot be very sorry because it gives new testimonies of your favour to me, of which I shall ever be very glad, and (that which

is my onely vertue) thankfull: so despe∣rate fortunes as mine, may well make friends loth to doe curtesies, because an in∣ability in deserving or requiting, takes from them the honour of having done a curtesie, and leaves it but the poor name of an alms; and alms may be given in easier proporti∣ons, and more meritoriously. But Sr, by what name or weight soever you esteem this kindnesse which you have done me, I value it so, as might alone perswade me of your care of me; in recompense of which, you must be pleased to accept new assuran∣ces that I am
I pray let my service be presented by you to Mr 
Your very affectionate servant,
J. Donne.
