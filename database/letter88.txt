To the Lady G.
MADAM,
I Am not come out of England, if I re∣main in the Noblest part of it, your minde; yet I confesse, it is too much di∣minution to call your minde, any part of England, or of this world, since every part even of your body, deserves titles of higher dignity. No Prince would be loth to die, that were assured of so faire a tombe

to preserve his memory: but I have a grea∣ter vantage then so; for since there is a Re∣ligion in friendship, and a death in absence, to make up an intire frame there must be a heaven too: and there can be no heaven so proportionall to that Religion, and that death, as your favour. And I am gladder that it is a heaven, then that it were a Court, or any other high place of this world, because I am likelier to have a room there then here; and better cheap. Madam my best treasure, is time; and my best im∣ployment of that, is to study good wishes for you, in which I am by continuall medi∣tation so learned, that your own good An∣gell, when it would do you most good, might be content to come and take in∣structions from
Your humble and affectionate servant
J. Donne.
