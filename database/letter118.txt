SIR,
WHen I was almost at Court, I met the Princes Coach: I thinke I o∣beyed your purposes best therefore, in comming hither. I am sure I provided best for my selfe thereby; since my best de∣gree of understanding is to bee governed by you. I beseech you give mee an assig∣nation where I may wait upon you at your commoditie this Evening. Till the per∣formance of which commandment from you, I rest here in the red Lion.
Your very thankefull and affectionate Servant
J. Donne.
