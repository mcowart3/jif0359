To my honoured friend  Esquire.
SIR,
I Should not only send you an account by my servant, but bring you an account of∣ten my self, (for our Letters are our selves) and in them absent friends meet) how I do, but that two things make me forbear that writing: first, because it is not for my gravity, to write of feathers, and strawes, and in good faith, I am no more, conside∣red in my body, or fortune. And then be∣cause whensoever I tell you how I doe, by a Letter, before that Letter comes to you, I shall be otherwise, then when it left me. At this time, I humbly thank God, I am only not worse; for, I should as soon look for Roses at this time of the year, as look for increase of strength. And if I be no worse all spring, then now, I am much bet∣ter, for, I make account that those Church services, which I would be very loth to de∣cline, will spend somewhat; and, if I can gather so much as will bear my charges, re∣cover

so much strength at  as I shall spend at  I shall not be loth to be left in that state wherein I am now, after that's done; But I do but discourse, I do not wish; life, or health, or strength, (I thank God) en∣ter not into my prayers for my self: for others they do; and amongst others, for your sick servant, for such a servant taken so young, and healed so long, is half a child to a master, and so truly I have observed that you have bred him, with the care of a father. Our blessed Saviour look graci∣ously upon him, and glorifie himself in him, by his way of restitution to health; And by his way of peace of conscience in
Your very true friend and servant in Chr. Jos.
