To the Right Honourable Sir  at Court.
SIR,
IF I should refuse the liberty which you enlarge to me, of eating in your cham∣ber, you might suspect that I reserved it for greater boldnesses, and would not spend it in this. But, in good faith, I do not eat before, nor can after, till I have been at home; so much hath my this years debi∣lity disabled me, even for receiving favours. After the Sermon, I will steal into my Coach home, and pray that my good pur∣pose may be well accepted, and my defects graciously pardoned. 

Yours intirely
J. Donne.
I will be at your chamber at one after noon.
