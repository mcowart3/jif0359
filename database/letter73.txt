To your self.
SIR,
I Send you here a Translation; but it is not onely to beleeve me, it is a great in∣vention to have understood any piece of this Book, whether the gravity of the mat∣ter, or the Poeticall form, give it his incli∣nation, and  you are his center, or his spheare, and to you as to his proper place he addresses himself. Besides that all my things, not onely by obligation, but by custome, know that that is the way they should goe. I spake of this to my L. of  thinking then I had had a co∣py which I made long since, at Sea, but be∣cause I finde it not, I have done that again:

when you finde it not unseasonable, let her see it; and if you can think it fit, that a thing that hath either wearied, or distasted you, should receive so much favour, put it amongst her papers: when you have a new stomach to it, I will provide you quickly a new Copy.

Your very true friend and servant and lover
J. Donne.
At my  Hospitall, Aug. 10.
