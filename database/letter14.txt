Roe so indulgent to his sorrow, as it had been an injury to have interrupted it with my unusefull company. I have done no∣thing of that kinde as your Letter inti∣mates, in the memory of that good Gentle∣woman; if I had, I should not finde any better use of it, then to put it into your hands.

I hope not for your return from Court, till I come thither; which if I can be master of my self, or servant to my self, which I think is all one, I hope to do some ten daies hence, ma∣king it my way to the Bathe. If you find any there that have not forgot my name, conti∣nue me in their favour, and hold in your self a firm assurance that I am
Your affectionate servant J. Donne.
J. Donne.
