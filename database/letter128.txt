To the Honourable Knight Sir  at Court.
SIR,
I Have obeyed the formes of our Church of  so much, as to have been a so∣lemn Christmas man, and tryed conclusi∣ons upon my selfe, how I could sit out the siege of new faces, every dinner. So that I have not seen the B. in some weeks. And I know not whether he be in case, to afford that privacy, which you justly desire. This day, I am in my bondage of entertaining. Suppers I presume, are inconvenient to you. But this evening I will spie upon the B. and give you an account to morrow morning of his disposition; when, if he cannot be intire to you, since you are gone so farre downwards in your favours to me, be plea∣sed to pursue your humiliation so farre as to chuse your day, and either to suffer the solitude of this place, or to change it, by such company, as shall waite upon you,

and come as a visitor and overseer of this Hospitall of mine, and dine or sup at this miserable chezmey.

Your humblest and thankfullest servant
J. Donne.
4 Jan. 1626.
