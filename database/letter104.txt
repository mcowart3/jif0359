SIR,
THE same houre that I received the honour of your commandments, by your letter left at my poore house, I put my selfe upon the way hither. So that I am here in the habite of a Traveller, and (suitable to the rest of my unworthinesses) unfit for great Presences. Therefore, I ab∣stain from waiting upon you presently; besides that in this abstinence, (except I misinterpret the last words of your letter to my advantage) I obey your directions, in sending before I come to you. How∣soever, Sir, I am intirely at your disposing, if you will be pleased to adde this favor to the rest, that I may understand, wherein you will use your Authoritie and Power, which you have over
Your poore and humble servant
John Donne.
