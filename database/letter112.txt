And since good Divines have made this argument against deniers of the Resurrection, that it is easier for God to recollect the Principles, and Elements of our bodies, howsoever they be scattered, then it was at first to create them of no∣thing, I cannot doubt, but that any di∣stractions or diversions in the ways of my hopes, will be easier to your Lordship to reunite, then it was to create them.

Your Lordships Most humble and devoted servant
J. Donne.
