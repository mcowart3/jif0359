To the Honourable Knight Sir 

SIR,
I Had rather like the first best; not onely because it is cleanlier, but because it re∣flects least upon the other party, which, in all jest and earnest, in this affair, I wish avoided. If my Muse were onely out of fashion, and but wounded and maimed like Free-will in the  I should adventure to put her to an Epithalamion. But since she is dead, like Free-will in our Church, I have not so much Muse left as to lament her losse. Perchance this busi∣nesse may produce occasions, wherein I may expresse my opinion of it, in a more serious manner. Which I speake neither up∣on any apparent conjecture, nor upon any overvaluing of my abilities, but out of a generall readinefse and alacrity to be ser∣viceable and gratefull in any kinde. In both which poor vertues of mine, none

can pretend a more primary interest, then you may, in
Your humble and affectionate servant
J. Donne.
