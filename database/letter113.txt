To the Hononrable Knight Sir 

SIR,
LEst you should think your selfe too much beholding to your fortune, and so relie too much upon her hereafter, I am bold to tell you, that it is not onely your good fortune that hath preserved you from the importunity of my visits all this time. For my ill fortune, which is stron∣ger, then any mans good fortune, hath concurred in the plot to keep us asunder, by infecting one in my house with the Measels. But all that, is so safely over∣worne, that I dare, not onely desire to put my selfe into your presence, but by your mediation, a little farther. For, esteeming my selfe, by so good a title, as my Lords own words, to be under his providence, and care of my fortune, I make it the best part of my studies how I might ease his Lordship by finding out

something for my selfe. Which, because I thinke I have done, as though I had done him a service therein, I adventure to desire to speake with him, which I beseech you to advance, in addition to your many fa∣vours and benefits to, me. And if you have occasion to send any of your servants to this town, to give me notice, what times are fittest for me to waite, to injoy your fa∣vour herein. My businesse is of that nature, that losse of time may make it much more difficult, and may give courage to the ill fortune of
Your humble servant
J. Donne.
