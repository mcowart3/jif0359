SIR,
THis evening, which is 5o  I finde your Letter of  day, and though I see by it, that it is a return of a Letter, not of the last weeks, and there∣upon make account, that my last weeks Letter hath satisfied you in some things which this Letter commands, concerning  yet for other things I would give you a drowsie relation, for it is that time of night, though I called it evening. At the Kings going from hence, upon  last, we made account to have seen Sir  Secretary, and Sir  Chancellor of the Exchequer, but they are not done, but both are fixed: my L.  received his staffe, with these two suits obtained from the King, That all Assignations might be transferred into the Exchequer, and so no paiments charged upon the Customes, nor Receivers, nor the Court of Wards, &c. And that for a time there might be a damp

cast upon Pensions, till they might be con∣sidered. In the Low Countries the Armies stirre not. In the Palatinate Sir  at∣tempting the regaining of  Castle, was surprised with the Enemy in so much strength, that they write it over for a Ma∣ster-piece, that he was able to make a retreat to  so that now the Enemy is got on that side the River which  is on, and I know nothing that can stand in his way. My L.  comes from  before he goes into  by Count  by the Palatinate, by  and there∣fore upon his comming, I shall be able to say something to you. In Sir  I presume you see an end of Sir  and we see an end of Mr  too; I beleeve he comes no more to the Prince. For the triall of my L. of  irre∣gularity, there is a Commission to sixe Bi∣shops,  and three onely elect,  S.  and  two Judges, L.  and  two Civilians, Sir  and D.  The

consecration of these elect Bishops, and consequently, my being Dean, must attend the issue of this Commission. Sir  is gone. The Proclamations of putting off the Parliament, till  are like to out∣run this Letter. It is very late; and it is one act, to say Grace after Supper, and to commend my self into the hands of my blessed Saviour, in my bed, and so close this Letter, and mine eies, with the same bles∣sing upon all your family. Amen.
Your poor servant in Chr. fes.
