To the same.
MADAME,
THis letter which I send enclosed hath been yours many moneths, and hath languished upon my table for a passage so long, that as others send news in their let∣ters, I send an antiquity in mine. I durst not tear it, after it was yours: there is some facriledge in defacing any thing consecrated to you, and some impiety to despaire that any thing devoted to you should not be re∣served

to a good issue. I remember I should have sent it by a servant, of whose diligence I see I was too confident. I know not what it says: but I dare make this letter no longer, because being very sure that I al∣ways think the same thoughts of you, I am afraid I should fall upon the same words, and so send one letter twice together.

Your very affectionate servant
J. D.
