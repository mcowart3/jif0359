To Sir 

SIR,
I Live so farre removed, that even the ill news of your great losse (which is ever swiftest and loudest) found me not till now, your letter speaks it not plain enough but I am so accustomed to the worst, that I am sure it is so in this. I am almost glad that I knew her so little: for I would have no more additions to sorrow. if I should com∣fort you, it were an almes acceptable in no other title, then when poor give to poor;

for I am more needy of it then you. And I know you well provided of Christian, and learned, and brave defences against all hu∣mane accidents. I will make my best haste after your messenger: and if my self and the place had not been ill provided of hor∣ses, I had been the messenger, for you have taught me by granting more to deny no request.

Your honest unprofitable friend
J. Donne.
3 a clock just as yours came.
