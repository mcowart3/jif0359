To my Honoured Friend, Master 

SIR,
YOur Letter was the more welcome to mee, because it brought your com∣mandment with it, of sending you per∣fumes: for it is a Service somewhat like a Sacrifice. But yet your commandment surprised me, when neither I had enough to send, nor had means to recover more; that Ladie being out of Towne which gavethem me. But Sir, if I had 10000000. I could send you no more then I doe; for I send all. If any good occasion present it selfe to you, to send to my L.  spare my name a roome, there where you offer him most of your Service. I dare contend with you, that you cannot exceed mee, in desiring to serve him. It is a better office from me to you, that I goe to bed, then that I write a longer letter. For if I doe mine eyes a little more injurie, I shall lose the

honour of seeing you at Michaelmas; for by my troth I am almost blinde: you may be content, to beleeve that I am always disposed to your service, without excepti∣on of any time, since now just at mid∣night, when it is both day, and night, and neither, I tell you that I am
Your affectionate friend and servant
J. Donne.
