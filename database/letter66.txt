To the worthy Knight Sir 

SIR,
YOur Letter comes to me, at Grace after supper; it is part of the prayer of that Grace, that God will blesse you, and all yours with his best blessings of both kinde. I would write you news; but your love to me, may make you apt to over-beleeve news for my sake. And truly all things that are upon the stage of the world now, are full of such uncertanities, as may justly make any man loth to passe a conjecture upon them; not only because it is hard to see how they wil end, but because it is misinter∣table and dangerous to conjecture other∣wise, then some men would have the event to be. That which is especially in my con∣templation, which is the issue of my L. of  businesse, (for thereupon de∣pends the consecration of my predecessor, upon which the Deanery devolves to the King) is no farther proceeded in yet, then that some of the 10 Commissioners have

met once; and upon Saterday next there will be a fuller meeting, and an entrance in∣to the businesse, upon which, much, very much in consequence, depends. Of my L. of  we are only assured, that he is in a good way of convalescence; but of any audience nothing yet. Slacken not your hold of my L. Treasurer, for I have been told that you are in his care. I send you a Copy of that Sermon, but it is not my co∣py, which I thought my L. of  would have sent me backe. This you must be pleased to let me have again, for I borrow it: for the other, I will pretermit no time to write it; though in good faith, I have half forgot it. If in any letter I leave out the name of the La.  or La.  or your daughters, tell them, that I named them. I take the falshood upon me; for I intend it very really, and very humbly, where I am good for any thing in any of their services. Our blessed Saviour continue and enlarge his blessings to you all, 

Your humble servant in Chr. Jes.
