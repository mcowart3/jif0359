To my good friend 

SIR,
THE little businesse which you left in my hands is now dispatched; if it have hung longer then you thought, it might serve for just excuse, that these small things make as many steps to their end, and need as many motions for the war∣rant, as much writing of the Clerks, as long expectation of a Seal, as greater. It comes now to you sealed, and with it as strong and assured seals of my service and love to you, if it be good enough for you. I owe you a continuall tribute of Letters. But Sir, even in Princes and Parents, and all States that have in them a naturall Sove∣raignty, there is a sort of reciprocation, and as descent to doe some offices due to them that serve them: which makes me look for Letters from you, because I have another as valuable a pawn therefore, as your friendship, which is your promise;

lest by the Jailors fault this Letter stick long, I must tell you, that I writ and sent it 12o  1600.

Your friend and servant and lover
J. Donne.
12. Decemb. 1600.
