To the Honoured Knight, Sir 

SIR,
I Amend to no purpose, nor have any use of this inchoation of health, which I finde, except I preserve my roome, and station in you. I beginne to bee past hope of dying: And I feele that a little ragge of  which I read last time I was in your Chamber, hath wrought prophetically upon mee, which is, that Death came so fast towards mee, that the over-joy of that recovered mee. Sir, I measure not my health by my ap∣petite, but onely by my abilitie to come to kisse your hands: which since I can∣not hope in the compasse of a few dayes,

I beseech you pardon mee both these in∣trusions of this Letter, and of that with∣in it. And though Schoole-men dis∣pute, whether a married man dying, and being by Miracle raised again, must bee remarried; yet let your Friendship, (which is a Nobler learning) bee con∣tent to admit mee, after this Resurrecti∣on, to bee still that which I was before, and shall ever continue,

Your most humble and thankfull Servant
J. Donne.
20. Mar.
