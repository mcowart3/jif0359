To the Noblest Knight Sr.  L. of  sent to him with his Book 

SIR,
I Make accompt that this book hath e∣nough performed that which it under∣took, both by argument and example. It shall therefore the lesse need to be it self a∣nother example of the Doctrine. It shall not therefore kill it self; that is, not bury it self; for if it should do so, those reasons, by which that act should be defended or excused, were also lost with it. Since it is con∣tent to live, it cannot chuse a wholsomeraire then your Library, where Authors of all complexions are presented. If any of them grudge this book a room, and suspect it of new or dangerous doctrine, you who know us all, can best moderate. To those reasons which I know your love to me will make in my favour and discharge, you may adde this, that though this doctrine hath not been taught nor defended by writers,

yet they, most of any sort of men in the world, have practised it.
Your very true and earnest friend and servant and lover
J. Donne.
