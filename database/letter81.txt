To Sir  at 

SIR,
THis 25 I have your letter of 21, which I tell you so punctually, because by it, nor by any other, I doe not discern that you received my pacquet of Books; not that I looked for so quick a return of the Sermon, nor of my Cases of conscience, but that I forget so absolutely what I write, and am so sure that I write confidently to you, that it is some pain to remain in any jealousie that any Letter is miscarried. That which

I writ to you of my L. Treasur. disposition to you, I had from Mr  and I understood it to be his desire to convey it through me. The last account which we have of my L.  is, by Letters of the 2o of this; by which also we saw, that the first Letters of his convalescence, were but propheticall; for he was let blood a second time, and is not strong enough yet to receive audience. Though I be not Dean of  yet, my L. of  hath gone so low, as to comâˆ£mand of me the office of being Master of my game, in our wood about him in  I pray be you content to be my officer too, the Steward of my services to all to whom you know them to be due in your walk, and continue your own assurance that I am
Your affectionate servant in Chr. fes.
J. Donne.
