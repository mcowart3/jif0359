To the Honourable Knight, Sir 

SIR,
I Sought you yesterday with a purpose of accomplishing my health, by the honour of kissing your hands. But I finde by my going abroad, that as the first Chri∣stians were forced to admit some  Ceremonies, onely to burie the Synagogue with honour, so my Feaver will have so much reverence and respect, as that I must keep sometimes at home. I must there∣fore be bold to put you to the pain of con∣sidering me. If therefore my Lord upon your deliverie of my last Letter, said no∣thing to you of the purpose thereof; let me tell you now, that it was, that in obedience of his commandment, to acquaint him with any thing which might advantage me, I was bold to present that which I heard, which was that Sir  was

likely to bee removed from  to the States; of which if my Lord said nothing to you, I beseech you adde thus much to your many other Favours, to intreate my Lord at his best commodity, to afford mee the favour of speaking with him. But if hee have already opened himselfe so farre to you, as that you may take knowledge thereof to him, then you may ease him of that trouble of giving mee an Audience, by troubling your selfe thus much more, as to tell him in my behalfe, and from mee, that though Sir  bee not removed, yet that place with the States lying open, there is a faire field of exer∣cising his favour towards mee, and of con∣stituting a Fortune to mee, and (that which is more) of a meanes for mee to doe him particular services. And Sir, as I doe throughly submit the end and effect of all Projects to his Lordships will, so doe I this beginning thereof, to your Advice and Counsell, if you thinke mee capable of it: as, for your owne

sake, I beseech you to doe, since you have admitted mee for
Your humble servant
J. Donne.
