To the Right Honourable Sir  at Court.
SIR,
THis morning I have received a signi∣fication from my Lord Chamber∣laine, that his Majesty hath commanded to morrows Sermon at S.  And that it is in the after-noon; (for, into my mouth there must not enter the word, after∣dinner, because that day there enters no

dinner into my mouth.) Towards the time of the service, I aske your leave, that I may hide my selfe in your out-chamber. Or if businesse, or privatenesse, or compa∣ny make that inconvenient, that you will be pleased to assigne some servant of yours to shew me the Closet, when I come to your chamber. I have no other way there, but you; which I say not, as though I had not assurance enough therein, but because you have too much trouble thereby; nor I have no other end there, then the Pulpit: you are my station, and that my exaltation; And in both, I shall ever endevour, to keep you from being sorry for having thought well of, or being ashamed of having testi∣fied well for
Your poor and very true servant in Chr. Jes.
J. Donne.
