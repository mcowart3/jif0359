To my very much respected friend Mr 

SIR,
I Thank you for expressing your love to me, by this diligence, I know you can distinguish between the voyces of my love, and of my necessity, if any thing in my Letters sound like an importunity. Besides, I will adde thus much out of counsell to

you, that you can do nothing so thriftily as to keep in your purpose the payment of the rest of this years rent, (though at your con∣veniency) for Sir  curiosity being so served at first, I shall be no farther cause, but that the rest be related, and you in as good possession of his love, and to as good use, as your love deserves of him. You mocke us when you aske news from hence. All is created there, or relates thither where you are. For that book which you com∣mand me to send, I held it but half an hour: which served me to read those few leafes, which were directed upon some few lines of my book. If you come to town quick∣ly, you may get a fair widow: for Mris  is fallen to that state by death of her husband. No man desires your comming more, nor shall be readier to serve you, then
Your affectionate friend and servant
J. Donne.
