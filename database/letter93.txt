To my Honoured friend Mr 

SIR,
I Cannot chuse but make it a presage that I shall have no good fortune in  that I mist the honour of enjoying that company, which you brought to town. But I beseech you let my ill luck determine in that ominousnesse: for if my not comming should be by her or you interpreted for a negligence or coldnesse in me, I were already in actuall and present affliction. For that Ecclesiasticall Lady of whom you write, since I presume it is a work of dark∣nesse that you go about, we will deferre it for winter. Perchance the cold weather, may be as good physique to you, as she, for quenching you. I have changed my purpose of going to  and will go directly into the Wight: which I tell you not as a concerning thing, but in obedi∣ence

to your commandement, as one poor testimony that I am
Your affectionate servant
J. Donne.
