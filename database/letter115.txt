To the Honourable Knight Sir Robert Karre, Gentleman of his Highnesses Bed chamber.

from this town goes with me my brother Sir Tho. Grimes and his Lady, and I with them. There we dine well enough I war∣rant you, with his father-in-law, Sir Tho. Hunt. If I keep my whole promise, I shall Preach both forenoon and afternoon. But I will obey your commandments for my return. If you cannot be there by 10, do not put your selfe upon the way: for, Sir, you have done me more honour, then I can be worthy of, in missing me so diligently. I can hope to hear M. Moulin again: or ru∣minate what I have heretofore heard. The onely misse that I shall have is of the ho∣nour of waiting upon you; which is some∣what recompensed, if thereby you take occasion of not putting not your self to that pain, to be more assured of the inabilities of
Your unworthy servant
J. Donne.
