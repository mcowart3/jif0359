To my most worthy friend Sir 

SIR,
BEcause evennesse conduces as much to strength and firmnesse as greatnesse doth, I would not discontinue my course of writing. It is a sacrifice, which though friends need not, friendship doth; which hath in it so much divinity, that as we must be ever equally disposed inwardly so to doe or suffer for it, so we must sepose some certain times for the outward service there∣of, though it be but formall and testimoni∣all: that time to met towards you is Tuesday, and my Temple, the Rose in Smith-field. If I were by your appointment your Refe∣rendarie for news, I should write but short Letters, because the times are barren. The low Countries, which used to be the Mart of news for this season, suffering also, or ra∣ther enjoying a vacation. Since therefore I

am but mine own Secretary (and what's that?) I were excusable if I writ nothing, since I am so: Besides that, your much knowledge brings you this disadvantage, that as stomachs accustomed to delicacies, finde nothing new or pleasing to them when they are sick; so you can hear nothing from me (though the Countrey perchance make you hungry) which you know not. Therefore in stead of a Letter to you, I send you one to another, to the best Lady, who did me the honour to acknow∣ledge the receit of one of mine, by one of hers; and who only hath power to cast the fetters of verse upon my free meditati∣ons: It should give you some delight, and some comfort, because you are the first which see it, and it is the last which you shall see of this kinde from me.

Your very affectionate lover and servant
J. Donne.
Micham the 14 August,
