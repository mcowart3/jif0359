To my Honoured friend M. 

SIR,
I Would I were so good an Alchimist to perswade you that all the vertue of the best affections, that one could expresse in a sheet, were in this ragge of paper. It be∣comes my fortune to deale thus in single money; and I may hit better with this hail-shot of little Letters (because they may come thick) then with great bullets; and trouble my friends lesse. I confesse it were not long enough if it came to present my thankes for all the favours you have done me; but since it comes to begge more, per∣chance it may be long enough, because I know not how short you will be with an absent friend. If you will but write that you give me leave to keep that name still, it shall be the gold of your Letter: and for allay, put in as much newes as you will. We are in a place where scarce any money appeares, but base: as, I confesse, all mat∣ters

of Letters is in respect of the testimo∣nies of friendship; but obey the corrupti∣on of this place, and fill your Letters with worse stuffe then your own. Present my service to all those Gentlemen whom I had the honour to serve at our lodging, I cannot flie an higher pitch, then to say, that I am so much their servant as you can say I am. At the Queens armes in  which is a Mercers, you may hear of one M.  who will convay any Let∣ter directed to me at Sir  at  though he know not me: and I should be glad to hear that this first that I sent into  had the fortune to finde you.
Yours
J. Donne.
