To Sir 

SIR,
I Writ to you once this week before; yet I write again, both because it seems a kinde of resisting of grace, to omit any commodity of sending into  and because any Pacquet from me into  should go, not only without just fraight, but without ballast, if it had not a letter to you. In Letters that I received from Sir  yesterday from  I had one of the 8 of  from you, and with it one from Mrs.  of the 28 of  which is a strange disproportion. But Sir, if our Letters come not in due order, and so make not a certain and concurrent chain,

yet if they come as Atomes, and so meet at last, by any crooked, and casuall applica∣tion, they make up, and they nourish bo∣dies of friendship; and in that fashion, I mean one way or other, first or last, I hope all the Letters which have been addressed to us by one another, are safely arrived, ex∣cept perchance that pacquet by the Cook be not, of which before this time you are cleare; for I received (as I told you) a Let∣ter by M.  and if you sent none by him, then it was that Letter, which the Cook tells you he delivered to M.  which, with all my criticismes, I cannot re∣concile; because in your last Letter, I find mention of things formerly written, which I have not found. However, I am yet in the same perplexity, which I mentioned before; which is, that I have received no syllable, neither from her self, nor by any other, how my wife hath passed her danger, nor do I know whether I be increased by a childe, or diminished by the losse of a wife. I hear from  of many censures of my

book, of Mris.  if any of those censures do but pardon me my descent in Printing any thing in verse, (which if they do, they are more charitable then my self; for I do not pardon my self, but confesse that I did it against my conscience, that is, against my own opinion, that I should not have done so) I doubt not but they will soon give over that other part of that indictment, which is that I have said so much; for no body can imagine, that I who never saw her, could have any other purpose in that, then that when I had received so very good testimony of her worthinesse, and was gone down to print verses, it became me to say, not what I was sure was just truth, but the best that I could conceive; for that had been a new weaknesse in me, to have prai∣sed any body in printed verses, that had not been capable of the best praise that I could give. Presently after Easter we shall (I think) go to  to be there at the election, where we shall meet Sir  and Sir  and after that we are de∣termined

to passe some time, in the Pala∣tinate. I go thither with a great deale of de∣votion; for me thinkes it is a new kinde of piety, that as Pilgrims went heretofore to places which had been holy and happy, so I go to a place now, which shall be so, and more, by the presence of the worthiest Princess of the world, if that marriage pro∣ceed. I have no greater errand to the place then that at my return into  I may be the fitter to stand in her presence, and that after I have seen a rich and abundant Countrey, in his best seasons, I may see that Sun which shall always keep it in that height. Howsoever we stray, if you have leasure to write at any time, adventure by no other way, then M.  at the Queens Armes, a Mercer, in  I shall omit no opportunity, of which I doubt not to finde more then one before we go from  Therefore give me leave to end this, in which if you did not finde the remem∣brance of my humblest services to my Lady  your love and faith ought to try

all the experiments of pouders, and dryings, and waterings to discover some lines which appeared not; because it is impossible that a Letter should come from me, with such an ungratefull silence.

Your very true poor friend and servant and lover
J. Donne.
This day begins a History, of which I doubt not but I shall write more to you before I leave this town. Mon∣sieur  a person for birth, next heire to the Kingdome of  after the Kings children, (if the King of  were weary of it) and for allyance, sonne in law to D.  and for breeding in the wars and estate, the most remarkable man of the Religion, being Governour of S.  one of the most important towns which they of the Religion bold for their security, finding that some distasts between the Lieutenant and the Maior of the town, and him, were dangerously fomented by great persons, stole from Court, rode post to the town and removed these two persons. He sent his secretary, and another dependent of his to give the Queen sasisfaction, who is so far from recei∣ving it, that his messengers are committed to the
 likely to be presently tortured; all his friends here commanded to their houses, and the Queens com∣panies of light horse sent already thitherward, and foot companies preparing; which troops being sent against a place, so much concerning those of the Religion to keep, and where they abound in number and strength, cannot chuse but produce effects worthy your hearing in the next Letter.
