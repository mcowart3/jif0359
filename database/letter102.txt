To the Honourable Knight, Sir Robert Karre.

SIR,

Onely give it leave to tell you, that that L. whom perchance the K. may bee pleased to heare in it, is an old and mo∣mentanie man, and it may be late labour∣ing for his assistance, next Winter. Besides, since it may bee possible that the Master of the Rolles may a little resent this suite, there could be no fitter time, then now, to make him easie, as things stand with him at this time. If you stay in Towne this Night, and no longer, I beseech you af∣ford me a few of your late Minutes at your own lodging, where I will wait upon you according to any directions, which by this Gent. or otherwise I shall receive from you.
Your humble servant
John Donne.
