 I. H.
SIR,
I Would not omit this, not Commodity, but Advantage of writing to you. This emptinesse in  dignifies any Letter from hence, as in the seasons, earlinesse and latenesse, makes the sowrenesse, and after the sweetnesse of fruits acceptable and gra∣cious. We often excuse and advance mean Authors, by the age in which they lived, so will your love do this Letter; and you will tell your self, that if he which writ it knew wherein he might expresse his affecti∣on, or any thing which might have made his Letter welcommer, he would have done it. As it is, you may accept it so, as we do many  manufactures, of which when we know no use, yet we satisfie our curiosity in considering them, because we knew not how, nor of what matter they were made. Near great woods and quar∣ries it is no wonder to see faire houses, but in  which wants both, it is.

So were it for me who am as farre removed from Court, and knowledge of forein pas∣sages, as this City is now from the face and furniture of a City, to build up a long Letter and to write of my self, were but to inclose a poor handfull of straw for a token in a Letter: yet I will tell you, that I am at  onely to provide for Monday, when I shall use that favour which my Lady  hath afforded me, of giving her name to my daughter; which I mention to you, as well to shew that I covet any occasion of a gratefull speaking of her favours, as that, because I have thought the day is likely to bring you to  I might tell you, that my poor house is in your way and you shall there finde such company, as (I think) you will not be loth to accompany to 

Your very true friend
J. Donne.
