To the Countesse of 

MADAM,
AMongst many other dignities which this letter hath by being received and seen by you, it is not the least, that it was

prophesied of before it was born: for your brother told you in his letter, that I had written: he did me much honour both in advancing my truth so farre as to call a pro∣mise an act already done; and to provide me a means of doing him a service in this act, which is but doing right to my self: for by this performance of mine own word, I have also justified that part of his Letter which concerned me; and it had been a double guiltinesse in me, to have made him guilty towards you. It makes no difference that this came not the same day, nor bears the same date as his; for though in inheritances and worldly possessions we consider the dates of Evidences, yet in Let∣ters, by which we deliver over our affecti∣ons, and assurances of friendship, and the best faculties of our souls, times and daies cannot have interest, nor be considerable, because that which passes by them, is eter∣nall, and out of the measure of time. Be∣cause therefore it is the office of this Letter, to convey my best wishes, and all the effects

of a noble love unto you, (which are the best fruits that so poor a soil, as my poor soul is, can produce) you may be pleased to allow the Letter thus much of the souls privilege, as to exempt it from straitnesse of hours, or any measure of times, and so beleeve it came then. And for my part, I shall make it so like my soul, that as that affection, of which it is the messenger, be∣gun in me without my knowing when, any more then I know when my soul be∣gan; so it shall continue as long as that.
Your most affectionate friend and servant
J. D.
