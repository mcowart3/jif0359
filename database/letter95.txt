To your selfe.
SIR,
ALl your other Letters, which came to me by more hazardous waies, had therefore much merit in them; but for your Letter by M.  it was but a little degree of favour, because the messenger was so obvious, and so certain, that you could not chuse but write by him. But since he brought me as much Letter as all the rest, I must accept that, as well as the rest. By this time, M.  when you know in your conscience that you have sent no Letter, you beginne to look upon the su∣perscription, and doubt that you have broken up some other bodies Letter: but whose so ever it were it must speak the same language, for I have heard from no body. Sir, if there be a Proclamation in  against writing to me, yet since it is there∣by become a matter of State, you might have told M.  so. And you might have

told him, what became of Sir  Letter, in my first pacquet, (for any Letter to him makes any paper a pacquet, and any peece of single money a Medall) and what became of my Lady  in my second, and of hers in my third, whom I will not name to you in hope that it is pe∣rished, and you lost the honour of giving it. Sir, mine own desire of being your servant, hath sealed me a Patent of that place du∣ring my life, and therefore it shall not be in the power of your for bidding, (to which your stiffe silence amounts) to make me leave being
Your very affectionate servant
J. Donne.
