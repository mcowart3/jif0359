To Sir 

SIR,
BEcause I am in a place and season where I see every thing bud forth, I must do so too, and vent some of my meditations to you; the rather because all other buds being yet without taste or virtue, my Let∣ters may be like them. The pleasantnesse of the season displeases me. Every thing re∣freshes, and I wither, and I grow older and not better, my strength diminishes, and my load growes, and being to passe more and more stormes, I finde that I have not only cast out all my ballast which nature

and time gives, Reason and discretion, and so am as empty and light as Vanity can make me; but I have over fraught my self with Vice, and so am riddingly subject to two contrary wrackes, Sinking and Over∣setting, and under the iniquity of such a disease as inforces the patient when he is al∣most starved, not only to fast, but to purge. For I have much to take in, and much to cast out; sometimes I thinke it easier to dis∣charge my self of vice then of vanity, as one may sooner carry the fire out of a room then the smoake: and then I see it was a new vanity to think so. And when I think sometimes that vanity, because it is thinne and airie, may be expelled with vertue or businesse, or substantiall vice; I finde that I give entrance thereby to new vices. Cer∣tainly as the earth and water, one sad, the other fluid, make but one bodie: so to aire and Vanity, there is but one  And that which later Physicians say of our bodies, is fitter for our mindes: for that which they call Destruction, which is a cor∣ruption

and want of those fundamentall parts whereof we consist, is Vice: and that  which is but the excrement of that corruption, is our Vanity and indis∣cretion: both these have but one root in me, and must be pulled out at once, or ne∣ver But I am so farre from digging to it, that I know not where it is, for it is not in mine eyes only, but in every sense, nor in my con∣cupiscence only, but in every power and affection. Sir, I was willing to let you see how impotent a man you love, not to dis∣hearten you from doing so still (for my vices are not infectious, nor wandring, they came not yesterday, nor mean to go away to day: they Inne not, but dwell in me, and see themselves so welcome, and find in me so good bad company of one another, that they will not change, especially to one not apprehensive, nor easily accessible) but I do it, that your counsell might cure me, and if you deny that, your example shal, for I will as much strive to be like you as I will wish you to continue good.
