To the Honourable Knight Sir  Gentleman of his Highnesses Bedchamber.
SIR,
I Have often sinned towards you, with a presumption of being pardoned, but now I do it, without hope, and without daring to intreat you to pardon the fault. In which there are thus many degrees of importunity. That I must begge of you to christen a child, which is but a daughter, and in which you must be content to be associated with Ladies of our own alli∣ance, but good women, and all this up∣on Thursday next in the afternoon. Sir, I have so many and so indeleble impressions

of your favour to me, as they might serve to spread over all my poor race. But since I see that I stand like a tree, which once a year beares, though no fruit, yet this Mast of children, and so am sure, that one year or other I should afflict you with this request, I had rather be present∣ly under the obligations and the thankful∣nesse towards you, then meditate such a trouble to you against another year. I was desirous this paper might kisse your hands as soon as you came, that if any other di∣versions made this inconvenient to you, I might have an other exercise of your favor, by knowing so much from you, who in every act of yours make me more and more

Your humble and thankfull servant
J. Donne.
17 Aprill.
