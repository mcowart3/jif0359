To Sr 

SIR,
YOU husband my time thriftily, when you command me to write by such a messenger, as can tell you more then I can write, for so he doth not onely carry the Letter, but is the Letter. But that the naming of some things, may give you occasion to ask him farther, and him to open himself unto you, give me leave to tell you, that the

now Spa. Embassadour proceeds in the old pace, the King hath departed from his ordi∣nary way so farre, as to appoint 9 of the Councell to treat with him; but when they came to any approaches, he answered, that he brought onely Commission to propose certain things, which he was ready to doe, but he had no instructions to treat, but ex∣pected them upon an other return from his Master. So that there is no treaty for the marriage begun yet: for I know you have heard  his free acknowledgement, that til the Prince came, there was no thoght of it. The King in his gests of this progress, hath determined it, not as heretofore, at  but at  during pleasure: so he is within a journey of  and even that circumstance addes to some other reasons, that he expects the Prince this Sum∣mer, and that Sir  in his last dis∣patches, enlarged the Prince in his liberty, from his Father, to come away, if he would. Amongst all the irregularities of this age, to me this is as strange as any, That this year

there is no peace, and yet no sword drawn in the world; & it is a lost conjecture to think which way any of the Armies will bend. Here it is imagined, that  and  (for, for any concurrence of love, it is but a dream) may so farre distresse  as that  must be recalled thither; and that if he be,  way is open into  where he may recompense great losses, whilest  and  and his Ex∣cellency and  keepthe ballance even in their parts, by looking upon another. This noble friend of yours is in his last minute, in this Town; and I am going into the Coach with my Lo to  If I might have forborn the sealing the rest till my re∣turn from thence, you might have heard something more from.

Your very true poor friend and humble servant in Chr. Jes. 
No straitnesse makes me forget my service to your daughters: If my Bell were tolling, I should pray for them, and though my Letter be sealing,

I leave not out my wishes, that their fortunes may second their goodnesse. Amen.
