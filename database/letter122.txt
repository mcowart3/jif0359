To the Right Honourable Sir 

SIR,
A Few hours after I had the honour of your Letter, I had another from my Lord of  and  commanding from the King a Copy of my Sermon. I am in preparations of that, with diligence, yet this morning I waited upon his Lord∣ship, and laid up in him this truth, that of the B. of  Sermon, to this hour, I never heard syllable, nor what way, nor upon what points he went: And for mine, it was put into that very order, in which I delivered it, more then two moneths since. Freely to you I say, I would I were a little more guilty: Onely mine innocency makes me afraid. I hoped for the Kings approbation heretofore in many of my Ser∣mons; and I have had it. But yesterday I came very near looking for thanks; for, in my life, I was never in any one peece, so studious of his service. Therefore, excepti∣ons

being taken, and displeasure kindled at this, I am afraid, it was rather brought thither, then met there. If you know any more, fit for me, (because I hold that unfit for me, to appear in my Masters sight, as long as this cloud hangs, and therefore, this day forbear my ordinary waitings) I be∣seech you to intimate it to
Your very humble and very thankfull servant
J. Donne.
