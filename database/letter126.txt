To the Right Honourable Sir  at Court,
SIR,
I Pursued my ambition of having the ho∣nour to kisse your hands some where, so farre, as to inform my selfe occasional∣ly of my great neighbour. And I perceive he is under an inundation of uncertain commers, which he cannot devest, ex∣cept I had your leave, to speake plain to him. A second inconvenience is, that he is so deafe, that we must speak to the whole house, if we will speake to him. And a third is, that I am in a riddling, rather a juggling indisposition, fast and loose, and therefore dare not stirre farre. Yet Sir, I am not thereby unfit to receive the honor of seeing you here, if greater businesse have not overcome, or worn out, your for∣mer inclinablenesse to come into these quarters. If you shall be pleased to say to my man, that you will make as though

you dined with me to day, and come, if your businesse require your going to his Lord∣ship, you may dine with him, after you have fasted with me. To day, or any day, which may be more yours, I aske it of you with all earnestnesse, on this side im∣portunity, which is the detestation of
Your humblest and thankfullest servant
J. Donne.
