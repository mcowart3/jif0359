To my Honoured friend M.  over against  house.
SIR,
I Do not make account that I am come to  when I get within the wall: that which makes it  is the meeting of friends. I cannot therefore otherwise bid my self welcome to  then by seeking of you, which both Sir  and I do, with so much diligence, as that this mes∣senger comes two dayes before to intreat you from us both, to reserve your self upon Saterday: so that I may, at our coming to  that night, understand at my house where I may send you word of our supping place that night, and have the honour of your company. So you lay more obligati∣ons upon
Your poor unprofitable servant
J. Donne.
