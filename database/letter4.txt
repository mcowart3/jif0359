To the Honourable Lady Mrs. 

MADAME,
I Have but small comfort in this letter; the messenger comes too easily to me, and I am too sure that the letter shall be de∣livered. All adventures towards you should be of more difficulty and hazard. But per∣chance I need not lament this; it may be so many of my letters are lost already that it is time that one should come, like  ser∣vant, to bring word, that the rest were lost. If you have had more before, this comes to

aske how they were received; and if you have had none, it comes to try how they should have been received. It comes to you like a bashfull servant, who though he have an extreme desire to put himself in your presence, yet hath not much to say when he is come: yet hath it as much to say as you can think; because what degrees so∣ever of honour, respect, and devotion, you can imagine or beleeve to be in any, this letter tells you, that all those are in me to∣wards you. So that for this letter you are my Secretary; for your worthiness, and your opinion that I have a just estimation of them, write it: so that it is as long, and as good, as you think it; and nothing is left to me, but as a witness, to subscribe the name of

Your most humble servant
J. D.
Though this letter be yours, it will not mis∣become or disproportion it that I mention your Noble brother, who is gone to  not to re∣turn till towards Christmas, except the business deserve him not so long.
