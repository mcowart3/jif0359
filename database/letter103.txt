To the Honourable Knight, Sir 

SIR,
IF I would calumniate, I could say no ill of that Gentleman: I know not whether my L. or my selfe tooke the first apprehension of it; but I remember that very soone wee concurred in a good opi∣nion of him; thereupon for justifying our owne forwardnesse, wee observed him more throughly, and found all the way good reason to ratifie our first esti∣mation of him. This gave my L. oc∣casion to send him abroade in his Service after: how hee satisfied him in that im∣ployment, indeed I know not. But, that I disguise nothing, I remember my L. told mee sometimes in his absence, that hee had not Account from him of some things, which hee had deposed in

him. And at his entering into his Coach, at his last going, I asked my L. Goes not the Gentleman with you? and hee told mee with some coldnesse no. So that if you bee not pressed to a Resolu∣tion, you may bee pleased to forbeare a few dayes, till I may occasionally dis∣cerne, whether hee have demerited or sunke in my L. opinion: And then you shall have another Character of him from

Your very humble and thankfull Servant
J. Donne.
25. Julii.
