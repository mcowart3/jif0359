SIR,
I Was loth to bee the onely man who should have no part in this great Festi∣vall; I thought therefore to celebrate that well, by spending some part of it in your company. This made mee seek you againe this after-noone, though I were guilty to my selfe of having done so every day since your comming. I confesse such an importunity is worthy to be punished with such a missing; yet, because it is the likeliest reparation of my Fortunes to hope upon Reversions, I would be glad of that Title in you: that, after solemnities, and businesses, and pleasures be passed over, my time may come, and you may afford some of your last leisures to

Your affectionate and humble servant
J. Donne.
