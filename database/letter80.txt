To the honourable Knight Sr 

SIR,
AS you are a great part of my businesse, when I come to  so are you when I send. More then the office of a vi∣sitation brings this Letter to you now; for I remember that about this time you pur∣posed a journey to fetch, or meet the Lad.  If you justly doubt any long absence, I pray send to my lodging my writ∣ten Books: and if you may stay very long, I pray send that Letter in which I sent you

certain heads which I purposed to enlarge, for I have them not in any other paper: and I may finde time in your absence to do it, because I know no stronger argument to move you to love me, but because you have done so, doe so still, to make my rea∣son better, and I shall at last prescribe in you

Yours,
J. Donne.
Micham Wednesday.
