To Sir H. Goodere.
SIR,
AGreeably to my fortune, and thoughts, I was crawld this back way from Key∣ston; through my broken casement at Bed∣ford, I saw, for my best dish at dinner, your Coach: I studied your gests, but when I knew where you were, I went out of this Town, in a doubt whether I should turn in to Wrest; and you know the wisdome of the Parliament is, to resolve ever in the Ne∣gative: Therefore it is likeliest I shall not come in there; yet, let me give you in pas∣sing, thus much account of my self: I thought to kisse my L. Spencers hands, at one house, and have passed three. If you know nothing to the contrary, risen since I came from London, I am likely to have a room in my L. of Dov. train, into the Countrie; if I have, I do not ask, but use the leave of wai∣ting upon you at home: There and ever elswhere, our blessed Saviour blesse you,

and all yours, in which number, I pray, ac∣count ever
Your very thankfull servant in Chr. Jes.
J. Donne.
