SIR,
THough my friendship be good for nothing else, it may give you the pro∣fit of a tentation, or of an affliction: It may excuse your patience; and though it can∣not allure, it shall importune you. Though I know you have many worthy friends of all rankes, yet I adde something, since I which am of none, would fain be your friend too. There is some of the honour and some of the degrees of a Creation, to make a friendship of nothing. Yet, not to annihilate my self utterly (for though it seem humblenesse, yet it is a work of as much almightinesse, to bring a thing to nothing, as from nothing) though I be not of the best stuffe for friendship, which men of warm and durable fortunes only are, I cannot say, that I am not of the best fashion, if truth and honesty be that; which I must ever exercise, towards you, because I learned it of you: for the conversation with wor∣thy men, and of good example, (though it

sow not vertue in us, yet produceth and ripeneth it. Your mans haste, and mine to  cuts off this Letter heve, yet, as in littell paterns torn from a whole piece, this may tell you what all I am. Though by taking me before my day (which I accoun∣ted Tuesday) I make short payment of this duty of Letters, yet I have a little comfort in this, that you see me hereby, willing to pay those debts which I can, before my time.

Your affectionate friend
J. Donne.

You forget to send me the Apology; and many times, I think it an injury to remember one of a promise, lest it confesse a distrust. But of the book, by occasion of reading the Deans answer to it, I have sometimes some want.
