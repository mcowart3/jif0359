To Sir  at 

SIR,
IT is true that M.  told you, I had that commandment from the King sig∣nified to me by my L. and am still under it, and we are within fourteen days of our time for going. I leave a scattered flock of wretched children, and I carry an infirme and valetudinary body, and I goe into the mouth of such adversaries, as I cannot blame for hating me, the Jesuits, and yet I

go. Though this be no service to my Lord: yet I shall never come nearer doing him a service, nor do any thing liker a service then this. Yesterday we had news by Sir  from  that the D. of  was elected King of  which would cut off a great part of the occasion of our going: but it is not much credible in it self, nor at all beleeved here, because it is not signified from  nor  Since M.  continues your Gazittier, I need tell you no∣thing of the  of  estate. For your commandment in memory of M.  I should not have sate so many processes, if I could incline my thoughts that way. It is not lazinesse, it is not gravity, nor coldnesse towards his memory, or your service; for I have thought of it oftner, and longer, then I was wont to do in such things, and no∣thing is done. Your last pacquet, in which your daughter and I were joynt-commissi∣oners, was brought to me, because she was at  with the Queens body: but I sent her part to her, and my  to her,

who presents her service to you by me now, and says she will write next week, and so will I too, by Gods grace. You for∣get me absolutely and intirely, whensoever you forget me to that noble Countesse. God blesse you in all, 

Your true servant in Jes. Chr.
J. Donne.
