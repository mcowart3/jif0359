To my very much honoured friend  Esquire at 

SIR,
I Know not which of us wonne it by the hand, in the last charge of Letters. If you wonne, you wonne nothing, because I am nothing, or whatsoever I am, you wonne nothing, because I was all yours be∣fore. I doubt not but I were better delive∣red

of dangers of relapses, if I were at  but the very going would indanger me. Upon which true debility, I was for∣ced to excuse my selfe to my Lord Cham∣berlaine, from whom I had a Letter of command to have Preached the fifth of  Sermon to the King. A service which I would not have declined, if I could have conceived any hope of standing it. I beseech you intreat my Lord  in my behalfe, that he will be pleased to name  to my L.  and to wonder, if not to inquire, where he is. The world is disposed to charge my Lords honour, and to charge my naturall affection with neg∣lecting him, and, God knowes, I know not which way to turn towards him; nor upon any message of mine, when I send to kisse my Lords hands, doth my Lord make any kinde of mention of him. For the Dia∣mond Lady, when time serves, I pray look to it; for I would fain be discharged of it. And for the rest, let them be but re∣membred how long it hath been in my

hands, and then leave it to their discretion. If they incline to any thing, I should chuse shirt  rather under then above 4  Our blessed Saviour multiply his blessings upon that noble family where you are, and your self, and your sonne; as upon all them that are derived from
Your poor friend and servant
J. Donne.
