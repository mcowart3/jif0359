To Sir H. G.
SIR,
I Cannot obey you, if you go to morrow to Parsons-green, your company, that place, and my promise are strong induce∣ments, but an Ague flouts them all, of which I have had two such threatnings, that I provide against it by a little Physick. This is one fetter; but I have a pair: for I attend Sir Geo. Mores answer in a little busi∣nesse, of which I can have no account till his return, so I am fastned here, till after Sunday. As you are sure that I love you thorowly, so think this a good expressing of that, that I promise now, that I will cer∣tainly goe with you on Munday, in despite of these interruptions, and serve you with my company to the Bathe; which journie, it is time to hasten. But I pray think this

promise so much worth, that it may deserve your comming this way on Munday, for I make it with that reservation. God send you Hawks and fortunes of a high pitch.
Your honest affectionate
J. Donne.
