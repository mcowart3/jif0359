To the best Knight Sir 

SIR,
AT your conveniency, I pray send my Lady  this inclosed, but be pleased to put your self to some inconveni∣ence, (if it be so) to kisse my Lady  hands in my name, and to present my very humble service to her, and tell her, that no ill conscience of having deserved her, but only an obedience to her command∣ments, keeps me from saying to her self thus much; that this day I received a letter from my  of  written yesterday at  in that his Lordships sends me word, that

that favour which he hath formerly done me, in giving me  is now likely to fall upon me, because the Incumbent is dangerously ill: and because this is the sea∣son in which he removes from  thi∣ther, he desires (for I give you his own word) that he may be accommodate there, (if it fall now) as heretofore. Out of my absolute and intire readiness to serve that family, I sent back his messenger with this answer, that I esteemed it a great part of my good fortune, that I should become wor∣thy to be commanded by him. If my Lady will be pleased to direct me in what parti∣cular manner I may best serve her purpo∣ses, I shall gladly waite upon her at any time, to receive her command with as much devotion and thankfulnesse as I received the benefit. I beseech you make her beleeve it, as in any place you beleeve

Your poor servant in Chr. Jes.
