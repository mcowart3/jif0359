Happiest and worthiest Lady,
I Do not remember that ever I have seen a petition in verse, I would not therefore be singular, nor adde these to your other papers. I have yet adventured so near as to make a petition for verse, it is for those your Ladiship did me the honour to see in Twicknam garden, except you repent your making; and having mended your judge∣ment by thinking worse, that is, better, be∣cause juster, of their subject. They must needs be an excellent exercise of your wit, which speake so well of so ill: I humbly beg them of your Ladiship, with two such promises, as to any other of your composi∣tions were threatnings: that I will not shew them, and that I will not beleeve them; and nothing should be so used that comes from your brain or breast. If I should con∣fesse a fault in the boldnesse of asking them, or make a fault by doing it in a longer Letter, your Ladiship might

use your style and old fashion of the Court towards me, and pay me with a Pardon. Here therefore I humbly kisse your Ladi∣ships fair learned hands, and wish you good wishes and speedy grants.
Your Ladiships servant
J. Donne.
