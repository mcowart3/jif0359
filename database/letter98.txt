To the Honourable Knight Sir 

SIR,
BEcause to remain in this sort guilty in your Lordships opinion doth not one∣ly defeat all my future indevours, but lay a heavyer burden upon me, of which I am more sensible, which is ingratitude to∣wards your Lordship, by whose favours I have been formerly so much bound; I hope your Lordship will pardon me this care and diligence which I use to rectifie my self towards you. To which purpose I humbly beseech your Lordship, to admit thus much into your consideration, that I

neither hunted after this businesse at first, but apprehended it as it was presented to me, and might perchance have fallen into worse hands, nor proceeded otherwise ther∣in, then to my poor discretion at that time seemed lawfull and requisite and necessa∣ry for my reputation, who held my selfe bound to be able to give satisfaction to any who should doubt of the case. Of all which, if your Lordship were returned to your former favourable opinions of me, you might be pleased to make this some argu∣ment, that after his Majesty had shewed his inclination to the first motion made in my behalf, I was not earnest to urge and solicit that advantage of priority, but as became me, contented my self to joyne with him who had made a later petition therein: and as soon as I understood how it was opposed or distasted, I threw it down at your Lord∣ships feet, and abandoned it to your pleasure. Which it is necessary for me to say at this time, left, if he who was interessed with me in that businesse shall have proceeded any

farther therein since that time, your Lord∣ship might conceive new suspicions of me. That your Lordships name was at all used therein, or that any words of mine occasi∣oned such an errour in my servant, I am so sorry as nothing but a conscience of a true guiltinesse of having performed an in∣jury to your Lordship (which can never fall upon me) could affect me more. But I, who to the measure of my comprehen∣sion, have ever understood your Lordships nobility and evenness, cannot fear that your Lordship will punish an oversight, like a crime: which should be effected upon me, if your Lordship should continue your dis∣favour towards me, since no penalty could come so burdenous to my minde and to my fortune as that. And since the repose of both consists in your Lordships favour, I humbly intreat to be restored to your fa∣vour, giving your Lordship my faith in pawn that I wil be as wary of forfeting it by any second occasion, as I am sorry for this.
Yours
J. D.
