To your fair sister.
MADAM,
THe dignity, and the good fortune due to your Letter, hath preserved a pac∣quet so well, that through  and  it is at last come to me at  This good experience makes me in despite of contrary appearances, hope that I shall finde some messenger for this, before I re∣move, though it be but two dayes. For, even Miracles are but little and slight things, when any thing which either concernes your worthinesse is in consideration or my valuation of it. If I faile in this hope of a messenger, I shall not grudge to do my self this service of bringing it into  that you may hear me say there, that I have thus much profited by the honour of your conversation, and Contemplation, that I am, as your vertues are, every where equall; and that, that which I shall say then at  I thought and subscribed

at  which is, that I will never be any thing else, then
Your very humble and affectionate servant
J. Donne.
