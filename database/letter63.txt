To the honour able Knight Sir 

SIR,
SInce I received a Letter by your sonne, whom I have not yet had the honour to see, I had a Letter Pacquet from you by Mr  To the former, I writ before: In this I have no other commandement from you, but to tell you, whether Mr  have received from the K, any additions of ho∣nour, or profit. Without doubt he hath yet none. He is here, practising for the Mask; of which, if I mis-remember not, I writ as much as you desire to know, in a Letter which seems not, to have been come to you, when you writ. In the  business, the King hath declared himself by an en∣gagement, to assist him with 100000l a year, if the Warre continue. But I beleeve, he must farm out your  Bene∣volence for the paiment thereof. Upon the strength of this engagement, Sir  becomes confident in his hopes. If you stood in an equall disposition for the West,

and onely forbore, by reason of Mr  silence, I wonder; for I think, I told you, that he was gone; and I saw in Sir  hand, a Letter from him to you which was likely to tell you as much. Since I came from Court, I have stirred ve∣ry little: Now that the Court comes again to us, I may have something which you may be content to receive from

Your very affectionate servant
J. Donne.
