SIR,
SInce I received a Letter by your sonne, whom I have not yet had the honour to see, I had a Letter Pacquet from you by Mr Roe: To the former, I writ before: In this I have no other commandement from you, but to tell you, whether Mr Villers have received from the K, any additions of ho∣nour, or profit. Without doubt he hath yet none. He is here, practising for the Mask; of which, if I mis-remember not, I writ as much as you desire to know, in a Letter which seems not, to have been come to you, when you writ. In the Savoy business, the King hath declared himself by an en∣gagement, to assist him with 100000l a year, if the Warre continue. But I beleeve, he must farm out your Warwickshire Bene∣volence for the paiment thereof. Upon the strength of this engagement, Sir Rob. Rich becomes confident in his hopes. If you stood in an equall disposition for the West,

and onely forbore, by reason of Mr Martins silence, I wonder; for I think, I told you, that he was gone; and I saw in Sir Tho. Lucies hand, a Letter from him to you which was likely to tell you as much. Since I came from Court, I have stirred ve∣ry little: Now that the Court comes again to us, I may have something which you may be content to receive from

Your very affectionate servant
J. Donne.
