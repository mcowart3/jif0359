To Sir 

SIR,
I Love to give you advantages upon me, therefore I put my self in need of another pardon from you, by not comming to you; yet I am scarce guilty enough to spend much of your vertue from you, because I knew not of your being come till this your Letter told me so, in the midst of dinner at  this Monday. Sir, I am very truly yours; if you have overvalued me in any ca∣pacity, I will do what I can to overtake your hopes of me. I wish my self whatsoever you wish me; and so I do, what ever you wish your self. I am prisoner and close; else I had not needed this pardon, for I long much, and much more by occasion of your Letter, to see you: when you finde that

good Lady emptiest of businesse and plea∣sure, present my humble thanks; you can do me no favour, which I need not, nor any, which I cannot have some hope to de∣serve, but this; for I have made her opinion of me, the ballance by which I weigh my self. I will come soon enough to deliver my thanks to Sir  for your ease, whom I know I have pained with an ilfa∣voured Letter, but my heart hath one style, and character; and is yours in wishing, and in thankfulnesse.

J. Donne.
Peckham Monday afternoon.
