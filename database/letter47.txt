this paper opposed to those, with which you trusted me. It is (I cannot say the waigh∣tyest, but truly) the saddest lucubration and nights passage that ever I had. For it exercised those hours, which, with extreme danger of her, whom I should hardly have abstained from recompensing for her company in this world, with accompany∣ing her out of it, encreased my poor family with a son. Though her anguish, and my fears, and hopes, seem divers and wild di∣stractions from this small businesse of your papers, yet because they all narrowed themselves, and met in Via regia, which is the consideration of our selves, and God, I thought it time not unfit for this dispatch. Thus much more then needed I have told you, whilest my fire was lighting at Tri∣combs 10 a clock.
Yours ever intirely
J. Donne.
